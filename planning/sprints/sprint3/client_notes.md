# Requested Changes

* I believe your Application Architecure Diagram includes the contents of a class diagram along with the higher level components. Also, there is no Container Class diagram in your SRS.

* Application Architecture Diagram should show high level components, relationships, layers, etc.
* Container Class Diagrams should show all the classes in that container and interactions of those classes.
